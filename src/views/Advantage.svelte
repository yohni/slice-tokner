				We would get them on our platform and they would see the opportunity to create a fan driven digital
				economy where their digital content can be traded as NFTs and their most loyal fans can have
				the monetary value of their creator's currency increase significantly as they promote their digital
				currency across their channels while our native token holders benefit from the Tokners popularity.
